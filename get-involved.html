                        There are plenty of ways for you to join the World Wildlife Day celebrations, wherever you are.
                        World Wildlife Day has been observed in the past by people, groups and authorities around the world
                        and in various ways. Whether you take part in big events or even the smallest of gatherings, you
                        can help raise awareness of wildlife and promote conservation and sustainable use!
                        <br><br>
                        Here are some of our suggestions for this year's celebration:
                        <br><br>
                        Get to know the animal and plant species under threat where you live, in your area or country, and
                        find out more on the threats and challenges they and their habitats face, and what can be done to
                        conserve them. Share this knowledge with your family and friends.
                        <br><br>
                        Spread the world on social media: share your thoughts and upload a picture of yourself and those
                        closest to you with our action card, or use our Social Media Kit for inspiration.
                        <br><br>
                        Use our hastags for this year's celebration: #WorldWildLifeDay #WWD2020 #SustainingAllLife
                        #Biodiversity2020 #SustainableUse
                        <br><br>
                        And do follow the official Twitter, Facebook and Instagram account of World Wildlife Day.
                        <br><br>
                        Bring World Wildlife Day with you to class and talk to students and educators about wildlife and
                        biodiversity. Young people are the future leaders of wildlife conservation. A thriving planet and a
                        rich biodiversity are their brightright, and they deserve a future where humans live in harmony with
                        the wildlife that shares the planet with us.

                        Organize or enter a competition! It can take many forms, for examples, an art competition,
                        a photo competition, a speech competition on the world's rich biological diversity, or on the
                        links between all living creatures and their habitats. Or why not a World Wildlife Day
                        marathon? It’s up to you!

                Everyday wildlife protection
                <br><br>
                Wildlife conservation is an issue that needs attention every day.
                <br><br>
                The threats weighing on wildlife are often large and complex, so much so individuals might feel
                powerless about them. However, every person’s small actions add up to a much larger solution – making
                the difference between a species surviving or disappearing forever.
                <br><br>
                Just #DoOneThingToday to make a difference and help wildlife conservation.
                <br><br>
                <b>Set a Goal</b> – Live your daily life with the smallest negative impact on the environment, wildlife,
                their habitats, or the planet’s biodiversity.
                <br><br>
                <b>Mobilize</b> – Encourage local schools, clubs, governments and businesses to discuss wildlife conservation
                and what you and your community can do to help.
                <br><br>
                <b>Visit</b> – Aquariums, botanical gardens, national parks and nature reserves. Research holiday destinations
                and countries that work hard to protect wildlife and habitats.
                <br><br>
                <b>Consume Responsibly</b> – By not purchasing products made from illegally sourced protected wildlife or their
                parts and products, you can stop wildlife trafficking from being a profitable enterprise.
                More information can be found through your national or local wildlife authorities or the Convention on
                International Trade in Endangered Species or Wild fauna and Flora (CITES).
                <br><br>
                <b>Volunteer</b> – We cannot always give money, but we can donate our time. Often wildlife organisations and
                zoos have volunteer programs. You could also help clean beaches, rescue wild animals or teach tourists
                about your local habitat.
                <br><br>
                <b>Stay informed</b> – Learn more about our planet’s flora and fauna, including those that are in danger of
                extinction. Research ways that you or your community can conserve and protect wildlife. Inform yourself
                on current environmental matters and be aware of your individual impact on ecosystems and wildlife. Think globally, act locally.
                <br><br>
                <b>Speak up</b> – Share your knowledge, passion and questions about wildlife conservation with your friends,
                family and community – either in person or online.
                <br><br>
                <b>Reach out</b> – inform authorities if you have information on illegal logging, fishing and wildlife
                trafficking; whistle-blowers play a critical role in detecting wildlife crimes and holding criminal
                smugglers accountable.
