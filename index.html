                    Humanity is an inextricable part of the rich tapestry of life that makes up our world’s biological
                    diversity. All human civilizations have been and continue to be built on the use of wild and
                    cultivated species of flora and fauna, from the food we eat to the air we breathe.

                    However, it seems that humanity has forgotten just how much we need nature for our survival and
                    well-being. As our population and our needs continue to grow, we keep exploiting natural resources
                    - including wild plants and animals and their habitats - in an unsustainable manner.

                    We are extremely fortunate to count on the presence of an endless diversity of wild animals,

                    Humans around the world benefit every single day from wildlife. In many ways, our history is the
                    story of our species’ interaction with, and adaptation to, the diverse lifeforms present in our
                    close vicinity. Since time immemorial, we have used wild plants and animals for out most basic
                    needs: from the air we breathe, to the food we eat, to the materials we use for shelter and comfort.

            <p>
                On 20 December 2013, at its 68th session, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) proclaimed 3 March
                – the day of signature of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
                Flora (CITES) in 1973 – as UN World Wildlife Day to celebrate and raise awareness of the world’s wild
                animals and plants.
                <br><br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="hide-text">
                The UNGA resolution also designated the CITES Secretariat as the facilitator for the global observance
                of this special day for wildlife on the UN calendar. World Wildlife Day has now become the most
                important global annual event dedicated to wildlife.
                <br><br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="hide-text">
                World Wildlife Day will be celebrated in 2020 under the theme "Sustaining all life on Earth",
                encompassing all wild animal and plant species as key components of the world's biodiversity. This
                aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals 1, 12, 14 and 15, and their wide-ranging commitments on
                alleviating poverty, ensuring sustainable use of resources, and on conserving life both on land and
                below water to halt biodiversity loss.

                Earth is home to countless species of fauna and flora – too many to even attempt counting. This rich
                diversity, and the billions of years during which its myriad elements have interacted, are precisely
                what has made our planet inhabitable for all living creatures, including humans. Historically, we have
                depended on the constant interplay and interlinkages between all elements of the biosphere for all our
                needs: the air we breathe, the food we eat, the energy we use, and the materials we need for all
                purposes. However, unsustainable human activities and overexploitation of the species and natural
                resources that make up the habitats and ecosystems of all wildlife are imperiling the world’s
                biodiversity. Nearly a quarter of all species are presently at risk of going extinct in the coming
                decades, and their demise would only speed up the disappearance of countless others, putting us in
                danger as well.
                <br><br><br>

            <p class="hide-text">
                On World Wildlife Day 2020, we will celebrate the special place of wild plants and animals in their many
                varied and beautiful forms as a component of the world’s biological diversity. We will work to raise
                awareness of the multitude of benefits of wildlife to people, particularly to those communities who live
                in closest proximity to it, and we will discuss the threats they are facing and the urgent need for
                governments, civil society, private sector actors and individuals to add their voices and take actions
                to help conserve wildlife and ensure its continued use is sustainable.
